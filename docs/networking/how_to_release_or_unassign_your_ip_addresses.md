## Release or unassign your IP addresses

If you have an existing IP address currently attached to a virtual machine, you can choose to either: 

	* Release the IP address

	* Unassign the IP address

You can do this by clicking on the server with the IP address you wish to manage, go to __Servers__ > __Manage__ and click __View__ on a server.

Click on the __Network__ tab and in the __Public IP__ field, you should see your IP address along with a blue button labelled as __Manage__.

You will be presented with two options. If you __Release__ the IP address, the IP will be returned into the public pool and another user or account will be able to attain it. You shouldn't release the IP address if you simply wish to attach it to another machine or keep it for later use, click __Unassign__.

_Note: All unassigned IP addresses will continue to incur usage fees. Please check the [Pricing](https://ninefold.com/pricing/) page to see what you will pay per IP address._
