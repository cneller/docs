## General

#### How do I check the status of the Ninefold platform?

You can view service availability and upcoming maintenance plans at [status.ninefold.com](http://status.ninefold.com).

The status page is updated at the start and finish of any maintenance period as well as during any platform interruption.

We recommend that you log a support ticket if you experience availability or performance issues in addition to checking the service health page.

#### Can I contact support by phone?

You can log a ticket 24/7 through the portal for accounts, enquiries and technical issues.

#### How do I log a support ticket?

Log into your Ninefold account and select the drop down under your username (top right hand corner of the window).

Select tickets from the drop down list then choose create ticket.

Choose a category that we can help you with then populate the subject and description fields with content relating to your issue or query. You have the option to include a contact phone number (don't forget your area code!). Click the create ticket button.

Once your ticket has been submitted you will see it every time you visit it the support tab.

By clicking on an open ticket you are able to review comments from our support team, add additional comments or close the ticket.

#### Can you help with non-standard support requests?

In some cases you may request that the Ninefold team perform a function or service which is not part of our standard offering.

Examples include:

* Copying of cloud data to a portable disk
* Uploading of data from a portable disk
* System administrator tasks
* Data Recovery
* Virtual Machine import/export
* Password recovery

These services will be agreed prior to commencement.  We charge a rate of up to $800 excluding taxes per day plus or any part thereof. Any services are performed according to point 8 of our [Terms of Use](https://ninefold.com/terms-of-use/).

## App Promotion

#### If I have two or more apps do I get the discount for each one?

I see what you did there… no. One discount per customer only.

#### If I close my account and open it later do I still get the discount?

The promotion will only apply to accounts with active apps during the promo period. If you close your account and open another one while the offer is still on and deploy an app then you are in luck. If not, it will only apply to the original account (you don’t need to close your account, just spin down your resources).

#### I don’t have an app, I run virtual servers, how do I get involved?

You need to deploy an app to take advantage of this promotion. Now could be a great time to get into Ruby on Rails!

#### What if I pick another region?

The $50 applies to your account for the month regardless of region. Say what? Let's go with an example, if you have something in US West and something in Asia Pacific 1 the $50 comes off the total of the Ninefold services for that month.
