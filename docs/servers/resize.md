## How to Resize Your Server

1. Template your server and create a new server with the desired compute size.
2. Click the server from the dashboard you want to resize to view the server's details.
3. On the overview tab click resize. 
4. Select your desired compute size from the drop down list then click to initiate the change

Your server will now stop, update its service offering and return to its pre-resize state with your desired compute size.

**Note:** You cannot resize a 512MB-X1 service offering. You will need to template the machine instead and deploy from the template.
