## Access your server with Live View

Live View offers a quick and easy way to gain immediate access to your new server via the web interface.

Note: If you have an IP address associated with your virtual machine you are also able to access your server via traditional RDP / SSH protocols (if enabled)

1. From your dashboard, click the server you wish to access.
3. From your server detail view, click on the Live View tab.
4. You will now be taken to Live View where you are able to access your server directly.
