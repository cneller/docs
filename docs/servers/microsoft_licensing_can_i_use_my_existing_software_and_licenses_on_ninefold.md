## Microsoft Licensing - Can I Use My Existing Software And Licenses On Ninefold?

### Overview

Ninefold provide licensing for Microsoft software via our “Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA) with Microsoft.

You must use Ninefold’s supplied Microsoft licensing; it is not permissible to use Microsoft retail or OEM licenses on the Ninefold platform under Microsoft's current licensing model.

### Conditions

There are certain circumstances under which you may bring Microsoft licenses to the Ninefold platform:

1. You have your own [SPLA agreement with Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-options/spla-program.aspx).

2. You are a Microsoft enterprise customer and have a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement with Software Assurance and qualify under the “License Mobility” program. 

### License Mobility

Ninefold customers have the flexibility to move their on-premise Microsoft application to our Cloud Server platform at any time without incurring additional licensing fees. This benefit is available to Microsoft Volume Licensing (VL) customers with eligible applications covered by active Microsoft Software Assurance (SA) contracts. Not only will license mobility make the transition easier for existing SA customers, it provides customers, who prefer to purchase perpetual licenses, the ability to continue doing so while still taking advantage of the efficiencies that the Ninefold cloud offers. More details can be found [here](http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/software-assurance/license-mobility.aspx).

The server applications must be on the following list of eligible products:

* Microsoft Exchange Server
* Microsoft SharePoint Server
* Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft Lync Server
* Microsoft System Center Server
* Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server

To view a full list of products eligible for License Mobility, see the Software Assurance Benefits section of the [Microsoft Product Use Rights (PUR) document](http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/products/products.aspx). All customers using License Mobility through Software Assurance must complete a license verification process and Microsoft will verify that the customer has eligible licenses with active Software Assurance. The customer is responsible for managing true ups and renewals as required under their agreement.

This program does not include the Microsoft Windows Client operating system, Desktop application products (e.g. Microsoft Office), and Microsoft Windows Server operating systems.
