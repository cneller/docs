## Copy or move a server 

If you would like to copy or move a server into an alternative region, you must first create a template of the server(s). 

Once a template has been created you can use to create a new machine in another region.

Please be aware that once you have moved your server into an alternative region it will require a new public IP address, making it necessary to reconfigure your domain name's DNS records. You may want to point your domain name to Ninefold's name servers to simplify this process in the future.

Hosting your domain name on Ninefold's name servers will also allow you to take advantage of our global load balancing service which allows you to configure failover across multiple regions.
