## Setting up deployment notifications

Currently, services such as [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/), and others accept and display notifications such as when deployments have started and when they’ve ended. This is a handy way to apprise teams of when coworkers deploy.

On Ninefold, it’s super easy to do.  You’ll only need to use our [awesome CLI](http://www.ninefold.com/docs/getstarted/how_to_install_and_utilize_the_cli)!

Once you have the CLI installed, run in terminal:

	$ ninefold webhooks create SERVICE URL

where __SERVICE__ is the team communication platform, and __URL__ is the URL generated by their system.

Once you’ve got it set up, you’ll see our Brutus -- the shaved yak -- make an appearance letting you know your deployments are completing.
