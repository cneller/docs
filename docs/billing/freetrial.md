## How does the Free Tier work?

The free tier is available to new Ninefold customer accounts. To start using the Ninefold free tier, create a Ninefold account, deploy a Rails app, and enter a valid credit card. 

####  What do I get for free?

You get a 1.5GB Rails app server in the US region.  The free tier credit is applied per month.

#### Why do you need my billing information for the free tier?

We use your billing information to verify that you’re a real person, to prevent abuse of our free tier offer, and for when you use more than the free tier.  This also allows a smooth transition to larger architecture when you scale your app.

We ask that you add these details within 10 days of signing up to Ninefold. Accounts that do not have valid credit card information may be spun down.

####  Will you charge me?

We won’t charge you as long as your use doesn’t exceed the free usage tier - that’s a 1.5GB US App Server for free, per month.  If you do exceed it, we will only bill you for the part you exceed so you still get to benefit. 

####  How will the free tier be shown on the Ninefold Invoice?

We apply a credit of $50 per month to your invoice.  This means that if you consume more than the free tier you still benefit from the free tier. You must maintain an active app to be entitled to this discount.

####  I’m on your free tier, why is there a balance on my invoice?
 
When your usage goes above what is included in the free tier, these charges will be billed to your credit card. You will still receive the free tier credit. 

Some of the items that could make you exceed the free usage tier include - 
* Scaling your app to a larger server; adding more apps; adding a separate worker or database server
* Using a lot of data transfer - eg more than 14GB of outbound data per month (There is no charge for inbound traffic)
* Turning on backups for your database.

So if you want to pay nothing, stay within the constraints of the free tier and enjoy.

Unused credits do not carry over to the following month. 

####  If I have two or more apps do I get the free tier credit for each one?

I see what you did there… no. One free tier (or $50 credit per month) per customer only.

####  If I close my account and open it later do I still get the discount?

If you close your account and open another one while the offer is still on and deploy an app then you are in luck.  To be certain, spin one up now and enjoy the Ninefold experience

####  I don’t have a Rails app, I run virtual servers, how do I get involved?

You need to deploy a Rails app to take advantage of this promotion. Now could be a great time to get into Ruby on Rails!

####  What if I add a second region?

Because the free tier is applied on your invoice as a $50 per month credit, you will still benefit if you add a second region, or an Asia Pacific app server.  You’ll just pay for use above $50.  Let's go with an example, if you have something in US West and something in Asia Pacific 1 the $50 comes off the total of the Ninefold services for that month.
