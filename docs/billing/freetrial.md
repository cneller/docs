You will be entitled to a free trial period of 30 days (Trial Period) if you are using Ninefold for the first time. Make sure that before the expiration of the trial you enter your credit card details to keep your service running at the end of the trial. 

If you deploy an app within the first 30 days and provide a credit card, Ninefold will waive the first $50 of your montlhly usage every month going forward.  You must maintain an active app to be entitled to this discount.  $50 will allow you to deploy a 1.5GB combined box in the US and run the box with substantial bandwidth without any charge to you.
