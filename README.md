SUMMARY
=======

This project houses the online documentation for [Ninefold](http://ninefold.com).  Most of this documentation has been created by the Ninefold support team along with the engineers and other team members at Ninefold, but we've received and continue to encourage contributions from users and the community.  

To build and preview the entire set of docs simply run the following command, then point your browser to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000)

    $ git clone git://github.com/ninefold/docs.git
    $ cd docs
    $ mkdocs build
    $ mkdocs serve

If you'd like to make a contribution to the Ninefold documentation, please fork it and send a pull request when you have changes that you'd like to be pulled into the master branch.
